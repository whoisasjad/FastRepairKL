*Published on December 15, 2024 | By Fast Repair Team*

Your smartphone is an essential part of your daily life, and proper maintenance can significantly extend its lifespan while ensuring optimal performance. Here are expert tips from our technicians at Fast Repair to keep your device running smoothly.

## Battery Care: The Heart of Your Device

### Optimize Charging Habits
- **Avoid overnight charging** - Prolonged charging can degrade battery health
- **Use original chargers** - Third-party chargers may not provide optimal voltage
- **Keep battery between 20-80%** - This range is ideal for lithium-ion batteries
- **Avoid extreme temperatures** - Heat and cold can damage battery cells

### Battery Health Monitoring
Modern smartphones include battery health features:
- **iPhone**: Settings > Battery > Battery Health
- **Android**: Settings > Battery > Battery Usage

Replace your battery when health drops below 80% for optimal performance.

## Screen Protection Strategies

4. **Proper Handling** - Use both hands when possible, especially for larger devices

### Display Settings
- **Adjust brightness** - Auto-brightness saves battery and reduces eye strain
- **Use dark mode** - Reduces power consumption on OLED displays
- **Set appropriate timeout** - Shorter screen timeout saves battery

## Software Maintenance

### Regular Updates
