# Water Damage Recovery Guide: What to Do When Your Device Gets Wet

Water damage is one of the most common and potentially devastating problems that can affect your smartphone, tablet, or laptop. Acting quickly and correctly in the first few minutes can mean the difference between saving your device and needing a complete replacement.

## Immediate Actions (First 5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Power Down Immediately
- **Turn off the device immediately**: Don't wait to save files or close apps
- **Remove the battery if possible**: For devices with removable batteries
- **Don't try to turn it on**: This can cause short circuits and permanent damage
- **Avoid charging**: Never attempt to charge a water-damaged device

### Step 2: Remove Everything Possible
- **Take out SIM card and memory card**: Dry them separately
- **Remove protective cases**: Water can be trapped inside
- **Take out headphones or accessories**: These can hold moisture
- **Remove any port covers**: Allow air circulation

## What NOT to Do

### Common Mistakes That Make Damage Worse
- **Don't use a hair dryer**: Heat can damage internal components
- **Don't put it in rice**: This is largely a myth and wastes precious time
- **Don't shake the device**: This can spread water to undamaged areas
- **Don't press buttons**: This can push water deeper into the device
- **Don't use heat sources**: Ovens, radiators, or direct sunlight can cause damage

## Immediate Drying Process

### External Drying
- **Use absorbent towels**: Gently pat dry all external surfaces
- **Avoid wiping motions**: This can push water into ports and openings
- **Use cotton swabs**: Carefully absorb water from ports and speaker grilles
- **Tilt and rotate**: Allow gravity to help water drain from openings

### Disassembly (If Comfortable)
For experienced users only:
- Remove back cover if possible
- Take out battery (if removable)
- Remove any modular components
- Document assembly for reassembly

## Professional Drying Techniques

### What Professionals Do
- **Ultrasonic cleaning**: Removes corrosion and deposits
- **Isopropyl alcohol baths**: Displaces water and prevents corrosion
- **Specialized drying chambers**: Controlled temperature and humidity
- **Component-level cleaning**: Individual part treatment
- **Logic board treatment**: Prevents long-term corrosion damage

## DIY Drying Methods (Use with Caution)

### Silica Gel Method
- Use actual silica gel packets (not rice)
- Seal device with gel packets in airtight container
- Leave for 48-72 hours minimum
- Ensure gel packets don't directly touch device

### Vacuum Method
- Use vacuum to remove air and moisture
- Place device in sealed bag with vacuum
- Be gentle to avoid component damage
- Professional vacuum chambers are more effective

## Assessment After Drying

### Before Attempting to Turn On
Wait at least 48-72 hours before attempting to power on, then:
- **Visual inspection**: Check for remaining moisture in display
- **Port inspection**: Ensure all ports are completely dry
- **Battery check**: Look for swelling or corrosion
- **Smell test**: Detect any unusual odors

### Initial Power-On
- **Use lowest power setting**: If device has power controls
- **Watch for unusual behavior**: Strange sounds, flickering, overheating
- **Test basic functions**: Screen, speakers, charging, connectivity
- **Monitor battery performance**: Check for rapid drain or charging issues

## Types of Water and Damage Levels

### Fresh Water
- Least damaging type
- Quick action often successful
- Lower mineral content reduces corrosion
- Best recovery chances

### Salt Water
- Highly corrosive
- Leaves mineral deposits
- Requires professional cleaning
- More likely to cause permanent damage

### Contaminated Water
- May contain chemicals or debris
- Requires thorough professional cleaning
- Higher risk of component damage
- Professional assessment essential

## Signs of Successful Recovery

### Positive Indicators
- Device powers on normally
- All functions work as expected
- No unusual sounds or behaviors
- Battery performance is normal
- No moisture visible in display

### Warning Signs
- Intermittent functionality
- Reduced battery life
- Overheating during use
- Corrosion visible on ports
- Display irregularities

## Long-Term Monitoring

### What to Watch For
- **Gradual performance degradation**: May indicate ongoing corrosion
- **Battery issues**: Water damage often affects battery long-term
- **Connectivity problems**: Antenna and wireless components are vulnerable
- **Sensor malfunctions**: Accelerometer, gyroscope may be affected
