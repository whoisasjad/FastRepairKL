# Cracked Screen Solutions

Is your iPhone or Samsung screen cracked?  
Don’t risk further damage or injury. We restore your device’s display and touch—fast.

## Why Fix Your Screen Quickly?

A damaged screen is more than cosmetic:

- Can cause touch issues, dead spots, or display lines
- May let in dust or moisture, risking internal failure
- Sharp glass edges can injure your fingers

---

## What We Repair

**Typical Issues:**

- Cracked or shattered front glass
- Unresponsive or glitchy touch
- Black spots or lines on the display

**How Modern Screens Work:**  
Most screens combine three layers:

- **Outer Glass:** Protects and gives a smooth surface
- **Digitizer:** Senses your touch
- **LCD/OLED:** Shows the image

> On most iPhones and Samsungs, these are fused—so we replace the full assembly for best results.

**Supported:**  
All iPhones (8, X, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 series, Pro/Pro Max)  
All Samsung Galaxy (S, Note, A, Z Fold/Flip series)
